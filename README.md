Learning About Linux
# inteoduction
The main lessons learnt about Linux are presented in this document, which covers fundamental ideas, commands, and recommended practices.
# linux history
Linux computer operating system created in the early 1990s by Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds and the Free Software Foundation. While still a student at the University of Helsinki, Torvalds started developing Linux to create a system similar to MINIX, a UNIX operating system.Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel and oversaw open source development of the widely-used Linux operating system.
Other contributers in development of linux are:-
Andrew Morton (often referred to as Linus' right-hand man)
Greg Koah-Hartman (-stable branch and tons of other stuff)
Ingo Molnar (Completely Fair Scheduler, Exec Shield)
# evolution of linux
The evolution of the Linux kernel has been significantly influenced by its adoption in enterprise environments. The demands of commercial use have driven improvements in scalability, reliability, and security, making Linux a preferred choice for servers, cloud computing, and embedded systems.
# linux distros
A Linux distribution often shortened to "Linux distro" is a version of the open source Linux operating system that is packaged with other components, such as an installation programs, management tools and additional software such as the KVM hypervisor.
popular linux disteos are ubuntu,fedora linux,Arch linux, Black arch and many more.
# Basic linux commands
File and Directory Management
ls: List directory contents.
cd: Change the current directory.
pwd: Print the current working directory.
mkdir: Create a new directory.
rmdir <directory>: Remove an empty directory.
rm : Remove a file.
cp: Copy files or directories.
mv: Move or rename files or directories.
File Viewing and Editing
cat: Display the contents of a file.
less: View a file one page at a time.
nano or vi <file>: Edit a file in the terminal using text editors.
System Information
uname -a: Display system information.
top: Show running processes and system resource usage.
df -h: Show disk space usage.
free -h: Display memory usage.
# conclusion
Learning Linux equips us with essential skills for managing and navigating operating systems, especially in server environments and development contexts.
key learnings are :-
command line proficiency:
easy file management.
system monitoring .
full utilization of resources.
Advanced scriptimg and automation skills.Linux is a valuable skill : many organizations rely on linux for servers, cloude services and embedded services.
Open Source Community: Working with Linux fosters involvement in the open-source community, enhancing collaboration and innovation.
Foundation for Other Technologies: Knowledge of Linux is often a prerequisite for learning other technologies, such as DevOps, containerization such as Docker, and cloud computing.
